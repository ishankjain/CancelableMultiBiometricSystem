# DRDO summer intern work
I was a research intern in Defence Research and Development Organisation, India from 1st June 2019 to 15th August 2019.
There I worked on protection of biometric template.  
My works include: 
> Implemented multiple algorithms to extract biometric features of fingerprint, finger vein, iris and face using my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, machine learning and deep learning.  
> Studied many techniques on biometric template security such as salting, non-invertible transform and key-binding biometric cryptosystem.  
> Created and implemented a cancelable multibiometric model which converts the biometric features into  bspline curves, which are furthur processed to generate a high performance, irreversible and revocable system.
